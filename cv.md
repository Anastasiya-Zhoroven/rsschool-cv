**About myself**  
I've graduated from BSEU with master degree.   
I started my career as financial analyst in one of the "Big 4"company. I've been working in economics for 5 years and this year have decided to change the sphere.  
 Now I'm interested in front-end development and have started to study it with RS School. I'm confident that my willingness to learn new skills and develop myself will help me to become an excellent front-end developer.
